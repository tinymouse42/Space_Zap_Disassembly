# Space Zap Disassembly (coin-op arcade game)

This disassembly was started by myself a LONG, LONG time ago. There is much to write in this README file but it will have to wait as I have other obligations at the moment.
It is a extrememly "bare bones" with no comments and the last update was about 2008! In my work directories from that long ago I do have a listing file from where I compiled it but I don't know if it runs. 

Please note that this code was formatted to be compiled with TASM, so it may take a bit of conversion to get it to compile with ZMAC.

This README.md file will be updated with more details later.
